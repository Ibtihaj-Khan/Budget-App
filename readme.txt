Free Code Camp project for calculating deposits and withrawals. 
Tracks all deposits/withrawals as a list of objects.

Withdrawals/transfers between categories are rejected if not enough deposited.

Printing any instance of the category object prints out category along with a formatted string of transactions.

create_spend_chart takes in category objects then prints out an approximate chart of percentage in each category.
